## What is API?
According to MuleSoft API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API. 

## Open Weather API
Open Weather Map API is an API that gives developer information about current weather, daily forecast for 16 days, and 3-hourly forecast 5 days for particular city. It also gives interactive maps that show precipitation, clouds, pressure, wind around particular location. Developers can get the data in JSON, XML, and HTML formats.
